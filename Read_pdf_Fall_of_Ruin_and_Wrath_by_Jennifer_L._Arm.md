 Long ago, the world was destroyed by gods. Only nine cities were spared. Separated by vast wilderness teeming with monsters and unimaginable dangers, each city is now ruled by a guardianâ€”royalty who feed on mortal pleasure.
 
 Born with an intuition that never fails, Calista knows her talents are of great value to the power-hungry of the world, so she lives hidden as a courtesan of the Baron of Archwood. In exchange for his protection, she grants him information.
 
 When her intuition leads her to save a traveling prince in dire trouble, the voice inside her blazes with warningâ€”and promise. Today heâ€™ll bring her joy. One day he&#039;ll be her doom.
 
 When the Baron takes an interest in the traveling prince and the prince takes an interest in Calista, she becomes the princeâ€™s temporary companion. But the city simmers with rebellion, and with knights and monsters at her city gates and a hungry prince in her bed, intuition may not be enough to keep her safe.
 
 Calista must choose: follow her intuition to safety or follow her heart to her downfall.
 
 Breathtaking suspense and scorching romance meet in this immersive new fantasy from a mega-bestselling force, Jennifer L. Armentrout.
