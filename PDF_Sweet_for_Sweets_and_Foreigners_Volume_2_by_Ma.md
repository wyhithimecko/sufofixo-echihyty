Overview
Ami Satou works for Cobara, a company that specializes in sweets. While she may be good at sales, her confidence in pretty much everything else is low, which is why she hasn&#039;t even thought about dating since college. Instead, she fills up her imagination with romantic scenes from shoujo manga.Â 
 
 When she meets Alain Giraud, a handsome, older French man in charge of a new project she&#039;s assigned to work on, she begins to struggle to keep that romantic imagination in check... especially with Alain being so overly friendly! Ami keeps reminding herself that it&#039;s just because he&#039;s French, but will she be able to resist his romantic charm?
