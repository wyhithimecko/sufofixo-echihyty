Overview
Beau Eaton is the town prince, a handsome military hero with a tortured past. I&#039;m the outcast bartender, a shy girl from the wrong side of the tracks. He&#039;s thirty-five and all man, and I&#039;m twenty-two and all . . . virgin. He&#039;s also my fiancÃ©. Correction: my fake fiancÃ©. We start out as a bet. He doesn&#039;t believe that anyone holds my last name against me. So he offers me his to prove a point. It&#039;s win-win. He gets a break from his concerned family&#039;s prying, and I get a chance to shed my family&#039;s reputation while I save up to ditch this small town. He says all I have to do is wear his ring, follow his lead, and pretend I can&#039;t keep my hands off of him in public. But it&#039;s what happens between us in private that blurs all those carefully drawn lines. It&#039;s what transpires behind closed doors that doesn&#039;t feel like pretending at all. This engagement was supposed to be for show. This agreement? It has an end date. He once told me he&#039;d never fall in love. And yet here I am, head over heels for my fake fiancÃ©.
