Overview
The old order changeth once again in a glorious, fan-favorite period for Earthâ€™s Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers!
 
 The Avengers welcome the powerful new Captain Marvel, Monica Rambeau, into their ranks â€” just in time to witness the trial of one of their stalwart members, Hank Pym! Then, Thanosâ€™ fun-loving brother Starfox joins the roster for an adventure to the Inhumansâ€™ refuge on the moon and an uncanny team-up of sorts with the Fantastic Four â€” which will have lasting repercussions for the Vision! As Scarlet Witch fears for her synthezoid husband, Doctor Strange seeks her aid on a search for the Darkhold! But will a cash-strapped Spider-Man find gainful employment as the newest Avenger? Super villains cause pandemonium at Project Pegasus, and Hawkeye goes solo â€” but when Clint Barton meets Mockingbird, Cupid is the one firing all the arrows!
