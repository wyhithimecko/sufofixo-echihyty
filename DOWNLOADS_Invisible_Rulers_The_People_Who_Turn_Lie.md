An ‚Äúessential and riveting‚Äù (Jonathan Haidt) analysis of the radical shift in the dynamics of power and influence, revealing how the machinery that powered the Big Lie works to create bespoke realities revolutionizing politics, culture, and society.
 
 Ren√©e DiResta‚Äôs powerful, original investigation into the way power and influence have been profoundly transformed reveals how a¬†virtual rumor mill of niche propagandists increasingly shapes public opinion. While propagandists position themselves as trustworthy Davids, their reach, influence, and economics make them classic Goliaths‚Äîinvisible rulers who create bespoke realities to revolutionize politics, culture, and society. Their work is driven by a simple maxim: if you make it trend, you make it true.
 ¬†
 By revealing the machinery and dynamics of the interplay between influencers, algorithms, and online crowds, DiResta vividly illustrates the way propagandists deliberately undermine belief in the fundamental legitimacy of institutions that make society work.¬†This alternate system for shaping public opinion, unexamined until now, is rewriting the relationship between the people and their government in profound ways. It has become a force so shockingly effective that its destructive power seems limitless. Scientific proof is powerless in front of it. Democratic validity is bulldozed by it. Leaders are humiliated by it. But they need not be.
 ¬†
 With its deep insight into the power of propagandists to drive online crowds into battle‚Äîwhile bearing no responsibility for the consequences‚ÄîInvisible Rulers not only predicts those consequences but offers ways for leaders to rapidly adapt and fight back.
