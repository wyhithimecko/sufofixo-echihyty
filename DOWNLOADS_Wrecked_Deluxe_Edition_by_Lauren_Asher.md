Overview
New York Times bestseller and TikTok sensation Lauren Asher brings her signature heart, angst, and steam to a high-octane series of interconnected standalones featuring F1 drivers. When Elena is assigned as a PR manager to repair Jax Kingston&#039;s wrecked reputation, neither of them can predict what sparks between them. Jax Pills. Alcohol. Adrenaline. I&#039;m addicted to destructive decisions that numb my pain until I make a catastrophic mistake that jeopardizes my career. So to repair my broken reputation, my Formula 1 team hires Elena Gonzalez. She is a glorified babysitter paid to keep me in check during the race season, and I&#039;m hellbent on making her quit before either of us act on our attraction to one another. She&#039;s my damnation disguised as my salvationâ€¦and my newest addiction. Elena I begged the universe to help me with my financial struggles, and Jax Kingston answered my call with a public relations disaster. The job sounds simple in theory, but the broody British driver turns our hotel suite into a battleground, wielding his words as a weapon and his demons as an escape. I soon learn that to beat the enemy, I need to exploit his weaknesses, only for me to realize I&#039;m his biggest one.
